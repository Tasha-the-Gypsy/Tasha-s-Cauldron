Add the sugar to the melted butter, stir well. (I do this in a measuring cup or smaller bowl)
Add vanilla and egg, mix until combined.
In a separate bowl, mix together the dry ingredients.
Add the wets to the drys and stir until just smooth (if you overmix this I will come to haunt you. Nobody needs tough brownies)
Fold in the add-ins if you want them. Pour into your greased or parchment lined baking dish. I made this recipe for 2 ramekins, but mine broke so I use a Tasha sized baking dish. 
Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes, or until the center has risen, the surface looks glossy, and it doesn't jiggle when you move it. Or  however else you want to test for doneness, do that.
