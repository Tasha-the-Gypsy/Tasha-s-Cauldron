Add the oats to the bowl of a food processor and blitz until they're like a coarse floury texture.
measure the honey and peanut butter into a bowl and microwave for \~15 seconds until they're both kinda runny
Add everything except the jam to the honey bowl, and mix until it forms a dough
Set aside \~2/3-3/4c of the dough, press the rest into the bottom of a parchment lined 8x8 pan
Spread the jam on top of the dough in the pan (you can microwave it for \~10 seconds if it's not spreading)
Sprinkle the rest of the dough on top of the jam
Bake at 350 for \~23 minutes, then let cool completely in the pan before removing and slicing into bar-like shapes. Or don't. You do what you want.
