Add the chopped cabbage to a colander or strainer, and toss in about 6T salt. This help draw moisture out the dumplings, so they don't explode out of their wrappers from steam when you are cooking them. Set aside. Add the rest of the ingredients to a larger mixing bowl, and stir together, always stirring in one direction either clockwise or counterclockwise. This will make the dumpling filling stay together more, and be more tender because of the way the fat is emulsified as you are stirring. Feel free to use your hands, that's what I do. Once the cabbage has been sitting for about 15 minutes, squeeze the excess moisture out of it, and add to the pork mixture. Stir it in the same direction that you had been stirring previously. At this point I like to try the filling and see how it tastes, and if it needs more seasoning, more salt etc... Take a small amount of the filling, and fry it in a pan, taste it, and see if it needs anything added. If not, we can start stuffing the dumpling wrappers.
